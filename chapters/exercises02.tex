\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Subgroup Test:} Let $G$ be a group and $H$ be a non-empty subset of $G$. Show that $H$ is a subgroup of $G$ if and only if for all $a, b \in H$, the element $ab^{-1}$ is also in $H$.

  \item \textbf{Cyclic Group Properties:} Let $G = \langle a \rangle$ be a cyclic group of order $n$.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Prove that for any positive integer $m$, the element $a^m$ has order $\frac{n}{\text{gcd}(m, n)}$.
    \item Show that $G$ has exactly one subgroup of order $d$ for each divisor $d$ of $n$.
  \end{enumerate}

  \item \textbf{Permutations:} Consider the symmetric group $S_4$.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Write the permutation $(1\ 2\ 3\ 4)$ as a product of disjoint cycles.
    \item Compute the inverse of the permutation $(1\ 3)(2\ 4)$.
    \item Find the order of the permutation $(1\ 3\ 4)(2\ 4\ 3)$.
  \end{enumerate}

  \item \textbf{Cosets:} Let $G$ be a group and $H$ be a subgroup of $G$.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Show that any two left cosets of $H$ in $G$ are either disjoint or identical.
    \item Prove that all left cosets of $H$ in $G$ have the same cardinality as $H$.
    \item Let $g_1, g_2 \in G$. Show that $g_1H = g_2H$ if and only if $g_1^{-1}g_2 \in H$.
  \end{enumerate}

  \item \textbf{Factor Group:} Let $G$ be a group and $N$ be a normal subgroup of $G$.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Show that the factor group $G/N$ is a group under the operation $(g_1N)(g_2N) = (g_1g_2)N$.
    \item Prove that the order of the factor group $G/N$ is equal to the index of the normal subgroup $N$ in $G$, i.e., $|G/N| = [G : N]$.
    \item Let $H$ be a subgroup of $G$ containing $N$. Show that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the subgroups of $G/N$ and the subgroups of $G$ containing $N$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
