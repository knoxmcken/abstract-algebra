\begin{enumerate}
\item
Let $A = \{a, b, c\}$ and $B = \{1, 2\}$. Define a relation $R$ on $A \times B$ as follows: $(a_1, b_1)R(a_2, b_2)$ if and only if $b_1 = b_2$. Prove that $R$ is an equivalence relation on $A \times B$ and find the equivalence classes.

\item
Let $A = \mathbb{Z}$ and define a relation $R$ on $A$ as follows: for all $a, b \in A$, $aRb$ if and only if $a^3 \equiv b^3 \pmod{7}$. Prove that $R$ is an equivalence relation on $A$. What are the equivalence classes of $R$?

\item
Consider the set $A = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\}$. Define a relation $R$ on $A$ such that $aRb$ if and only if $a \equiv b \pmod{2}$. Prove that $R$ is an equivalence relation, find the equivalence classes, and show that they form a partition of $A$.

\item
Define a relation $R$ on the set $\mathbb{Q}$ (the set of rational numbers) as follows: for all $a, b \in \mathbb{Q}$, $aRb$ if and only if $a - b \in \mathbb{Z}$. Prove that $R$ is an equivalence relation on $\mathbb{Q}$ and find the equivalence classes.

\item
Let $S$ be the set of all ordered pairs $(a, b)$ of positive integers such that $a \leq b$. Define a relation $R$ on $S$ as follows: $(a_1, b_1)R(a_2, b_2)$ if and only if $a_1 + b_1 = a_2 + b_2$. Prove that $R$ is an equivalence relation on $S$ and describe the equivalence classes.
